### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Farheen and I am a Data Science enthusiast from Alberta, Canada. ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning models in R and Python. 

Past Projects (in my repository):
Hangman (just for fun) : Loops and Functions | 
Algorithm Designs involving Arrays, Grids, Stacks, Queues, Search & Swap Algorithms, Binary Trees, Heaps | 
Telecom Churn Prediction: Churn Customers - Decision Tree - Naive Bayes

Current Project:
Traffic Collision Prediction Framework for City of Calgary traffic data: I have just finished a few Python and R courses and ðŸ”­ my current focus is on completing my capstone project that will help me towards a Machine Learning role within the industry.
